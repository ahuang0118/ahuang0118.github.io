This post is a tutorial explaining how to construct an interesting data visualization of the Palmer Penguins data set.

### 1. Importing data
First of all, the data is imported into Python by runnning the following 
```python
import pandas as pd
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16B/master/datasets/palmer_penguins.csv"
penguins = pd.read_csv(url)
```
