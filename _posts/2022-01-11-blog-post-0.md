This post is a tutorial explaining how to construct an interesting data visualization of the Palmer Penguins data set.

### Importing data
First of all, the data is imported into Python by runnning the following 
```python
import pandas as pd
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16B/master/datasets/palmer_penguins.csv"
penguins = pd.read_csv(url)
```
### Plotly Express
I am going to plot a simple histogram using *plotly express*, showing the number of eggs on each date by species and island:


```python
from plotly import express as px

# plot histogram 
fig = px.histogram(penguins,
                  x = "Date Egg",
                  color= "Species",
                  barmode="stack",
                  )

# show the plot
fig.show()
```
{% include fig0-1.html %}


### Facet
Then, I am going to make the plot slightly fancier by grouping the data into subsets using **facetting**.
Facetting refers to creating multiple, small plots, each of which display a subset of the data. Plotly supports the easy creation of facets using the `facet_col` and `facet_row` arguments. In this case, I will simply group the data by island:


```python
fig = px.histogram(penguins,
                  x = "Date Egg",
                  color= "Species",
                  barmode="stack",
                  facet_row="Island", # code for facetting
                  )

fig.show()
```
{% include fig0-2.html %}



### Styling
Now, let's make the plot prettier by using `fig.update layout`. I am going to make the following changes:
1. adjust the white space using `margin`
2. change the plot size using `width` and `height` arguments
3. move the legend to the top right corner using `legend` (`xanchor` and `yanchor` determines the anchor point of the legend box)


```python

fig.update_layout(# reduce whitespace
                  margin={"r":0,"t":0,"l":0,"b":0}, 
                  # adjust plot size
                  width= 1020, height = 630,
                  # move legend position 
                  legend=dict(yanchor="top",
                              y=0.99,
                              xanchor="right",
                              x=0.97
                             )
                 )

# show the modified plot
fig.show()

```
{% include fig0-3.html %}
